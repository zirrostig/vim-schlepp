Move and duplicate selected text. Does nothing unless keys are bound to the
various commands.

Moving text around                                  *schlepp*

1. Schlepp Movement                 |schlepp-movement|
2. Schlepp Duplication              |schlepp-duplication|
3. Schlepp Options                  |schlepp-configuring|

==============================================================================
SCHLEPP MOVEMENT                                    *schlepp-movement*

These are intended to be the most frequently used commands. They work in
|linewise-visual| and |blockwise-visual| modes. Regular visual mode is not
supported at the moment, but may be supported in the future. Once text is
selected, you can freely move it around your file, and text will reflow around
the selection being moved, based on the |visual-mode| being used.

In |blockwise-visual| mode, |schlepp| will automatically remove trailing
whitespace from selections, due to its use of 'virtualedit' settings adding lots
of whitespace in many cases, it tries to clean up after itself, but may
inadvertently remove intentional whitespace. See |schlepp-trim-ws| to change the
default.

Command               Action ~
<Plug>*SchleppUp*       Moves selected text up 1 line.
<Plug>*SchleppDown*     Moves selected text down 1 line.
<Plug>*SchleppLeft*     Moves selected text to the left 1 char. By default will
                      not allow text to be "squished" to the left upon hitting
                      the left most column. See |schlepp-squishing|.

<Plug>*SchleppRight*    Moves selected text to the right 1 char.

The recommended mappings are. >
    vmap <unique> <up>    <Plug>SchleppUp
    vmap <unique> <down>  <Plug>SchleppDown
    vmap <unique> <left>  <Plug>SchleppLeft
    vmap <unique> <right> <Plug>SchleppRight
<

                                                    *schlepp-reindent*
Additionally when moving text |schlepp| can automatically use vim's reindent
command as text is moved, making moving code around really easy (assuming your
indentation style matches vim's).
Note: This only works in |linewise-visual| mode.

Command                             Action ~
<Plug>*SchleppToggleReindent*         Used to toggle reindentation mode on and
                                    off. Default off. See |schlepp-toggle-reindent|
<Plug>*SchleppIndentUp*               Moves selection up, and reindents.
<Plug>*SchleppIndentDown*             Moves selection down, and reindents.

I like to map just the toggle function. >
    vmap <unique> i <Plug>SchleppToggleReindent
<

Some behaviors when moving text can be changed with a couple settings.

==============================================================================
SCHLEPP DUPLICATION                                 *schlepp-duplication*

While text is selected, it can be duplicated in one of a couple directions.
|linewise-visual| lets you duplicate above or below the selected text, and
|blockwise-visual| allows any of the four directions. By default |schlepp| will
strip any trailing whitespace from the newly placed text.

Command                 Action ~
<Plug>*SchleppDup*        Duplicates the selected text in the default direction,
                        below for |linewise-visual| and to the right for
                        |blockwise-visual|. The defaults can be changed,
                        |schlepp-options|

<Plug>*SchleppDupUp*      Duplicates the selected text and places it above the
                        current selection.

<Plug>*SchleppDupDown*    Duplicates the selected text and places it below the
                        current selection. This is the |linewise-visual|
                        default. See |schlepp-dup-lines| to change default.

<Plug>*SchleppDupLeft*    Duplicates the selected text and places it to the left
                        of the current selection. Only works in
                        |blockwise-visual|.

<Plug>*SchleppDupRight*   Duplicates the selected text and places it to the
                        right of the current selection. Only works, and is the
                        default in |blockwise-visual|. See |schlepp-dup-block|
                        to change default.

If you want just the basic dupliction behavior, and are happy with always
duplicating in the same direction then the following may be a decent mapping. >
    vmap <unique> D <Plug>SchleppDup
<

If you want the fine grained control over duplication direction. The following
may be more appealing. >
    vmap <unique> Dk <Plug>SchleppDupUp
    vmap <unique> Dj <Plug>SchleppDupDown
    vmap <unique> Dh <Plug>SchleppDupLeft
    vmap <unique> Dl <Plug>SchleppDupRight
<

SCHLEPP OPTIONS                                     *schlepp-configuring*
                                                    *schlepp-options*

Any of the following options can be set in your |vimrc| if you would like to
change them from the default.

Option                      Default     Behavior ~
*g:Schlepp.allowSquishing*    0           *schlepp-squishing*
                                        Enabling will let lines with leading
                                        spaces move left, even when other lines
                                        in the selection cannot move left.

*g:Schlepp.trimWS*            1           *schlepp-trim-ws*
                                        Disabling prevents schlepp from removing
                                        trailing whitespace in
                                        |blockwise-visual| selections after
                                        movement.

*g:Schlepp.reindent*          0           *schlepp-toggle-reindent*
                                        Enabling will make schlepp by default 
                                        auto-reindent text when moving.

*g:Schlepp.moveIntoFolds*     0           *schlepp-move-into-folds*
                                        Todo: Finish functionaly, and document

*g:Schlepp.dupTrimWS*         0           *schlepp-dup-trim-ws*
                                        Enabling will make schlepp trim trailing
                                        whitespace from newly duplicated text.
                                        Default is off since this really isn't a
                                        common problem, and it slows down the
                                        operation slightly if its enabled.

*g:Schlepp.dupLinesDir*       "down"      *schlepp-dup-lines*
                                        Only other valid direction is "up".
                                        Changes the default behavior of
                                        |SchleppDup| in |linewise-visual| mode.

*g:Schlepp.dupBlockDir*       "right"     *schlepp-dup-block*
                                        Valid directions are "up", "down",
                                        "right", and "left". Changes the default
                                        behavior of |SchleppDup| in
                                        |blockwise-visual| mode.
